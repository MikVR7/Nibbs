# Nibbs

Nibbs is a little puzzle-casual-game for VR I wrote over the weekend (01. July 2022) to stay up to date in Virtual Reality with the Oculus Quest system.

For this project I use [Auto Hand - VR Physics Interaction](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/auto-hand-vr-physics-interaction-165323)
And [Odin - Inspector and Serializer](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041)
